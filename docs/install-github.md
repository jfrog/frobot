   - Create a new [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment)
   called **frogbot** and add people or public teams as reviewers. The chosen reviewers can trigger Frogbot scans on pull requests.

   - Push the workflow files to the **.github/workflows** directory in the root of your **Frogbot Management Repository**.
