# Installing Frogbot on Azure Repos repositories

| Important: Using Frogbot with Azure DevOps isn't recommended for open source projects. Read more about it in the [Security note for pull requests scanning](../README.md#-security-note-for-pull-requests-scanning) section. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

To install Frogbot on Azure Repos repositories, follow these steps.

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.

2. Decide which repository branches you'd like to scan.

3. Go to your Azure Pipelines project, and add a new pipeline.

4. Set `Azure Repos Git` as your code source.

5. Select your `Frogbot Management Repository`.

6. Select `Starter Pipeline` and name it `frogbot`.

7. Use the content of the below template for the pipeline. Edit the remaining mandatory `Variables`.

8. For the pipeline you created, save the JFrog connection details as variables with the following names - JF_URL, JF_USER, and JF_PASSWORD.

   > **_NOTE:_** You can also use **JF_XRAY_URL** and **JF_ARTIFACTORY_URL** instead of **JF_URL**, and **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN**
   > instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**.

   To set the `Variables` in the pipeline edit page, click on the `Variables` button and set the `Variables`.
