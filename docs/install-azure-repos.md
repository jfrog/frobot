# Installing Frogbot on Azure Repos repositories

To install Frogbot on Azure Repos repositories, follow these steps.

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.

2. Decide which repository branches you'd like to scan.

3. Go to your Azure Pipelines project, and add a new pipeline.

   ![azure-new-pipeline.png](../images/azure-new-pipeline.png)

4. Set `Azure Repos Git` as your code source.

   ![azure-set-code-source.png.png](../images/azure-set-code-source.png)

5. Select the repository you'd like Frogbot to scan.

   ![azure-select-repo-to-test.png](../images/azure-select-repo-to-test.png)

6. Select `Starter Pipeline` and name it `frogbot-scan-pr`.

   ![azure-starter-pipeline.png](../images/azure-starter-pipeline.png)

7. Use the content of the below template for the pipeline. Edit the list of branches in the template according to the branches you'd like Frogbot to scan.

    ```

   Edit the yaml of the pipeline you created, and set the relevant branches to be scanned, as well as the remaining mandatory `Variables`.
    </details>

10. For each of the two pipelines you created, save the JFrog connection details as variables with the following names - JF_URL, JF_USER, and JF_PASSWORD.

    > **_NOTE:_** You can also use **JF_XRAY_URL** and **JF_ARTIFACTORY_URL** instead of **JF_URL**, and **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN**
    > instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**.

    To set the `Variables` in the pipeline edit page, click on the `Variables` button and set the `Variables`.

    ![variables_button.png](../images/azure-variables-button.png)

    ![img_1.png](../images/azure-new-variable.png)

11. To enable pull request scanning, you must set up `Branch Policies` for the relevant target branches Frogbot should scan. Go to Azure Repos -> Branches.

    <img src="../images/azure-branches.png" alt="azure-branches.png" width="200"/>

12. For each branch, select the `More Options` icon next to the branch, and then select `Branch Policies`.

    <img src="../images/azure-branch-policies.png" alt="azure-branch-policies.png" width="800"/>

13. Add Build Validation Policy.

    ![azure-build-validation.png](../images/azure-build-validation.png)

14. Fill out the `Add build policy` form with the relevant `Build pipeline` field. Set the `Trigger` option to `Automatic` and save.
