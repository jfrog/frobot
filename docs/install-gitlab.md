# Installing Frogbot on GitLab repositories
To install Frogbot on GitLab repositories using GitLab CI:

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Go to your GitLab repository settings page and save the JFrog connection details as repository secrets with the following names - **JF_URL**, **JF_USER**, and **JF_PASSWORD** 
> **_NOTE:_** You can also use **JF_XRAY_URL** and **JF_ARTIFACTORY_URL** instead of **JF_URL**, and **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**
3. Add a job named **frogbot-scan** to your **.gitlab-ci.yml** file in your GitLab repository using the code block below.

**Important**
- For npm, yarn 2, NuGet or .NET: Make sure to set the command in a way that it downloads your project dependencies as
  the value of the **JF_INSTALL_DEPS_CMD** variable. For example, `npm i` or `nuget restore`
- Make sure that either **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD** or **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** are set, **but not both**.
