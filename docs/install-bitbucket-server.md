# Installing Frogbot on Bitbucket Server repositories
Frogbot is installed on Bitbucket Server repositories using JFrog Pipelines or Jenkins.

#### Using JFrog Pipelines
To install Frogbot using JFrog Pipelines:

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Save the JFrog connection details as a [JFrog Platform Access Token Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Platform+Access+Token+Integration) named **jfrogPlatform**.
3. Save your Bitbucket access token as a [Generic Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Generic+Integration) named **bitbucket** with the token as the key and the Bitbucket access token as the value.
4. Create a Pipelines job with the below pipelines.yml content.
5. In the **pipelines.yml**, make sure to set values for all the mandatory variables.
6. In the **pipelines.yml**, if you're using a Windows agent, modify the code inside the onExecute sections as described on the yaml comments.

**Important**
- For npm, yarn 2, NuGet or .NET: Make sure to set inside the pipelines.yml the command in a way that it downloads
  your project dependencies as the value of the **JF_INSTALL_DEPS_CMD** variable. For example, `npm i`
  or `nuget restore`
- Make sure that all necessary build tool that are used to build the scanned project are installed on the Pipelines
  agent.

```

#### Using Jenkins
To install Frogbot using Jenkins:

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Save the JFrog connection details as Credentials in Jenkins with the following Credential IDs: **JF_URL**, **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD** (You can also use **JF_XRAY_URL** and **JF_ARTIFACTORY_URL** instead of  **JF_URL** and **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**).
3. Save your Bitbucket access token as a Credential in Jenkins with the BITBUCKET_TOKEN Credential ID.
4. Create a Pipeline job in Jenkins with the below Jenkinsfile content.
5. In the Jenkinsfile, set the values of all the mandatory variables.
6. In the Jenkinsfile, modify the code inside the `Download Frogbot` and `Scan Pull Requests` according to the Jenkins agent operating system.

**Important**
- For npm, yarn 2, NuGet or .NET: Make sure to set inside the Jenkinsfile the command in a way that it downloads your
  project dependencies as the value of the **JF_INSTALL_DEPS_CMD** variable. For example, `npm i` or `nuget restore`
- Make sure that either **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD** or **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** are set in the Jenkinsfile, but not both.
- Make sure that all necessary build tool that are used to build the scanned project are installed on the Jenkins agent.
