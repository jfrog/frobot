## Starter Workflows

The Frogbot Code Scanning workflow is configured in this directory.
Two files can be edited: frogbot-scan-pr.yml, which configures the scan workflow, and forgbot-fix.yml, which opens a new
Pull Request with the necessary changes if a vulnerability is found.
To start using Starter-Workflows please refer the GitHub documentation:
