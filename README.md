## ü§ñ What is Frogbot?
Frogbot is a Git bot that scans your pull requests and repositories for security vulnerabilities. You can scan pull requests when they are opened, and Git repositories following new commits.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw-AAxtAVwY"><img width="30%" src="./images/frogbot-screencast.png"></a>

## Scan pull requests when they are opened
### General 
Frogbot uses [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) (version 3.29.0 and above is required) to scan your pull requests. It adds the scan results as a comment on the pull request. If no new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot will also add a comment, confirming this.

Supported platforms:
- Bitbucket Server
- GitHub
- GitLab

Supported package management tools:
- Go
- Gradle
- Maven
- .NET
- npm
- NuGet
- Pip
- Pipenv
- Yarn 2

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How does Pull Request scanning work?
<details>
  <summary>GitHub</summary>

After you create a new pull request, the maintainer of the Git repository can trigger Frogbot to scan the pull request from the pull request UI. 

> **_NOTE:_** The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request.
Vulnerabilities that aren't new, and existed in the code before the pull request was created, will not be included in the
report. In order to include all of the vulnerabilities in the report, including older ones that weren't added by this
PR, use the JF_INCLUDE_ALL_VULNERABILITIES environment variable.

The Frogbot GitHub scan workflow is:
1. The developer opens a pull request.
2. The Frogbot workflow automatically gets triggered and a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) named `frogbot` becomes pending for the maintainer's approval.

[![](./images/github-pending-deployment.png)](#running-frogbot-on-github)

3. The maintainer of the repository reviews the pull request and approves the scan: [![](./images/github-deployment.gif)](#running-frogbot-on-github)
4. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by repeating steps 2 and 3.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>GitLab</summary>

After you create a new merge request, the maintainer of the Git repository can trigger Frogbot to scan the merge request from the merge request UI. 

> **_NOTE:_** The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the merge request.
Vulnerabilities that aren't new, and existed in the code before the merge request was created, will not be included in the
report. In order to include all of the vulnerabilities in the report, including older ones that weren't added by this
merge request, use the JF_INCLUDE_ALL_VULNERABILITIES environment variable.

The Frogbot GitLab flow is as follows: 
1. The developer opens a merge request.
2. The maintainer of the repository reviews the merge request and approves the scan by trigerring the manual *frogbot-scan* job.
3. Frogbot is then triggered by the job, it scans the merge request, and adds a comment with the scan results.
4. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by triggering the *frogbot-scan* job again.

<details>
  <summary>Bitbucket Server</summary>

After you create a new pull request, Frogbot will automatically scan it.

> **_NOTE:_** The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request.
Vulnerabilities that aren't new, and existed in the code before the pull request was created, will not be included in the
report. In order to include all of the vulnerabilities in the report, including older ones that weren't added by this
PR, use the JF_INCLUDE_ALL_VULNERABILITIES environment variable.

The Frogbot scan on Bitbucket Server workflow:
1. The developer opens a pull request.
2. Frogbot scans the pull request and adds a comment with the scan results.
3. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by adding a comment with the `rescan` text.

</details>

### Scan results

Frogbot adds the scan results to the pull request in the following format:

#### üëç No issues
If no new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot automatically adds the following comment to the pull request:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/frogbot/master/resources/noVulnerabilityBanner.png)](#-no-issues)

#### üëé Issues were found
If new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot adds them as a comment on the pull request. For example:

## Scanning repositories following new commits

Frogbot scans your Git repository and automatically opens pull requests for upgrading vulnerable dependencies to a
version with a fix.

> **_NOTE:_** This feature is currently supported for GitHub and GitLab only.

For GitHub repositories, Frogbot also adds [Security Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository) which you can view in the GitHub UI:

![](./images/github-code-scanning.png)

Frogbot uses [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) for the scanning. The scanning is triggered following commits that
are pushed to the repository.

Supported package management tools:

- Go
- Maven
- npm
- Pip
- Pipenv
- Yarn 2

## üñ•Ô∏è Installing and using Frogbot
<details>
  <summary>Setting up a FREE JFrog Environment in the Cloud</summary>

Frogbot requires a JFrog environment to scan your projects. If you don't have an environment, we can set up a free environment in the cloud for you. Just run one of the following commands in your terminal to set up an environment in less than a minute.

The commands will do the following:

1. Install [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI) on your machine.
2. Create a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud for you.

**For macOS and Linux, use curl**

```
curl -fL https://getcli.jfrog.io?setup | sh
```

**For Windows, use PowerShell**

```
powershell "Start-Process -Wait -Verb RunAs powershell '-NoProfile iwr https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/v2-jf/[RELEASE]/jfrog-cli-windows-amd64/jf.exe -OutFile $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\jf.exe'" ; jf setup
```

After the setup is complete, you'll receive an email with your JFrog environment connection details, which can be stored as secrets in Git.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Setting up Frogbot on GitHub repositories</summary>

To install Frogbot on GitHub repositories using GitHub Actions: 

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Go to your GitHub repository settings page and save the JFrog connection details as repository secrets with the following names - **JF_URL**, **JF_USER**, and **JF_PASSWORD** 

> **_NOTE:_** You can also use **JF_XRAY_URL** and **JF_ARTIFACTORY_URL** instead of **JF_URL**, and **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**
   
   ![](images/github-repository-secrets.png)

3. Check the Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests check box. 

   ![](images/github-pr-permissions.png)

4. Create a new [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) called **frogbot** and add people or public teams as reviewers. The chosen reviewers can trigger Frogbot scans on pull requests.

   ![](images/github-environment.png)

5. Use our [GitHub Actions templates](templates/github-actions/README.md#frogbot-gitHub-actions-templates) to add Frogbot workflows to your project.
6. Push the workflow files to the **.github/workflows** directory in the root of your GitHub repository.
