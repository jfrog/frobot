## ü§ñ What is Frogbot?

Frogbot is a Git bot that scans your pull requests with JFrog Xray for security vulnerabilities. Frogbot can be easily triggered following the creation of a new pull request. Frogbot adds the scan results as a comment on the pull request. If no vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot will also add a comment, confirming this. Currently GitHub and GitLab are supported. Bitbucket will be supported soon.

## üïµ How does it work?

After a new pull request is created, one of the maintainers can add the "Frogbot scan" label to the pull request. Frogbot will then be triggered and the pull request will be scanned. The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request. Vulnerabilities that existed in the code prior to the pull request created will not be added to the report.

### Using Frogbot with GitHub Actions

For a super quick start, we created [GitHub Actions templates](templates/github-actions/README.md#github-actions-templates) under [templates/github-action](templates/github-actions/).

Here's a recommanded structure of a `frogbot.yml` workflow file:

```yml
name: "Frogbot"
on:
  # After a pull request opened, Frogbot automatically creates the "üê∏ frogbot" label if needed.
  # After "üê∏ frogbot" label was added to a pull request, Frogbot scans the pull request.
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, labeled]
jobs:
  scan-pull-request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

      # Install prerequisites - "setup-go", "setup-node", "setup-python", etc.
      # ...

      - uses: jfrog/frogbot@v1
        env:
          # [Mandatory] JFrog platform URL
          JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}

          # [Mandatory if JF_USER and JF_PASSWORD are not provided] JFrog access token with 'read' permissions on Xray service
          JF_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_USER }}

          # [Mandatory if JF_ACCESS_TOKEN is not provided] JFrog platform username
          JF_USER: ${{ secrets.JF_USER }}
          # [Mandatory if JF_ACCESS_TOKEN is not provided] JFrog platform password
          JF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.JF_PASSWORD }}

          # [Mandatory] The GitHub token automatically generated for the job
          JF_GIT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          # [Optional] Xray Watches. Learn more about them here: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray+Watches
          JF_WATCHES: <watch-1>,<watch-2>...<watch-n>

          # [Optional] JFrog project. Learn more about them here: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Projects
          JF_PROJECT: <project-key>

          # [Optional] The command that installs the dependencies. For example - "npm i", "nuget restore", "dotnet restore", "pip install", etc.
          JF_INSTALL_DEPS_CMD: <your-install-command>
