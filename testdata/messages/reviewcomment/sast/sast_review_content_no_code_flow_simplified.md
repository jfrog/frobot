### Overview
Stack trace exposure is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program reveals
sensitive information, such as the names and locations of internal files and variables,
in error messages or other diagnostic output. This can happen when a program crashes or
encounters an error, and the stack trace (a record of the program's call stack at the time
of the error) is included in the output.
